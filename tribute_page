          <h3>Brief Biography</h3>
          <p>Known as El Libertador (The Liberator), Simon Bolivar was a Venezuelan military and political leader who is renowned for playing the leading role in many Latin American countries achieving independence. Born in a wealthy aristocratic family, Bolivar lost his parents when he was young. He married at the young age of 18 but lost his wife to disease within a year, an event which proved to be a turning point in his life and pushed him toward the independence movements taking place in South America. He had educated in Europe he arrived in Spain at sixteen years of age where he became acquainted with the Enlightenment philosophers who instilled the seeds of a yearning for independence for his country from Spanish rule.</p>
          <p>
    He was able to take advantage of Spain's preoccupation with the Peninsular War to start his own campaign which culminated in the Battle of Carabobo and the victory won by the patriots finally succeeding in making Venezuela an independent country. Though Bolivar was able to establish Gran Colombia; which included the territories of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama and Peru; his dream of a united South America ultimately failed with its regions becoming sovereign states.</p>
